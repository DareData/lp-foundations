This is an useful reference guide for Python application layouts. Although it's not a tutorial, it's a good piece to keep for future reference.

Note that the guide is from 2018, so we still see references of files that are now (in 2022) being replaced by the `pyproject.toml` configuration file (which replaces the `requirements.txt`, `MANIFEST.in` and `setup.py` files)

After this lesson you should:

- How to design command line applications,
- How to recognize web applications frameworks.

The Cookiecutter Data Science project is a template for data science projects. It's a good starting point for many projects. It's opinionated, but all its opinions are justified.

After this lesson you should:

- Have a reference on how to layout projects involving data flows.
