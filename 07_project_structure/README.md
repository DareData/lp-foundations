This is an useful reference guide for Python application layouts. Although it's not a tutorial, it's a good piece to keep for future reference.

Note that the guide is from 2018, so we still see references of files that are now (in 2022) being replaced by the `pyproject.toml` configuration file (which replaces the `requirements.txt`, `MANIFEST.in` and `setup.py` files)

After this lesson you should:

- How to design command line applications,
- How to recognize web applications frameworks.

## Cookiecutter Data Science (0:15)

The Cookiecutter Data Science project is a template for data science projects. It's a good starting point for many projects. It's opinionated, but all its opinions are justified.

After this lesson you should:

- Have a reference on how to layout projects involving data flows.

## Python virtual environments

[Link to RealPython article](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

A detailed guide on Python virtual environments, focusing on `venv`. It removes the mystery of what virtual environments and the files in them are (although it can go too in-depth at times).

After this lesson you should:

- Know how to work with virtual environments as well as how they work.
