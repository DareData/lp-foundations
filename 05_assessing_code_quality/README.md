# Assessing Code Quality: Reviews and Architecture

Code reviews are the bread-and-butter of collaborative software development. Not only they are a way to ensure that code is of high quality, but also a way to share knowledge and learn from each other.

Our goal here is to equip you with the skills to critically evaluate other people's code: we will focus on project structure, what code smells to look for, and how to give feedback.

## Call to Action

1. Read about [Project Structure](./1_project_structure.md) and learn how to organize your codebase. A well-organized codebase makes understanding and reviewing code a breeze.
2. These practical [Code Review Guidelines](./2_code_reviews.md) will help you give feedback in a code review.
3. Read about some of the [Code Smells](./3_code_smells.md) to be aware of during code reviews. That will help you sniff out bad practices and improve code quality.
