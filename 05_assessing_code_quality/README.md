# Assessing Code Quality: Reviews and Architecture

Code reviews are the bread-and-butter of collaborative software development. Not only they are a way to ensure that code is of high quality, but also a way to share knowledge and learn from each other.

Our goal here is to equip you with the skills to critically evaluate other people's code: we will focus on project structure, what code smells to look for, and how to give feedback.

## Call to Action

1. Read about [Project Structure](./1_project_structure.md) and learn how to organize your codebase. A well-organized codebase makes understanding and reviewing code a breeze.
2. These practical [Code Review Guidelines](./2_code_reviews.md) will help you give feedback in a code review.
3. Read about some of the [Code Smells](./3_code_smells.md) to be aware of during code reviews. That will help you sniff out bad practices and improve code quality.
4. For the next weekly session, you will be asked to review the structure of an existing project. Choose a project from your team and review its organization. What would you change? What would you keep? Why?

## Assignment #2

It's time for Assignment #2! From now on, every assignment will require your code to be reviewed by your peers. You will be able to review other people's code as well.

### Assignment #2 covers

- Code refactoring
- Code review

Good luck and don't forget to treat your code reviewer with care! ðŸ¤—
