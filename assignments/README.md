# Foundations Learning Path Assignments

## Introduction

This assignment uses life expectancy in Europe grouped by Country (or other, like group of countries), Age, Sex, and Time. But the data format makes it hard to use. The task consists into cleaning the data and applying the concepts you've learned in the previous modules.

## Installing

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
  > **Note for Anaconda users**: We would prefer if you exit the automatic conda environments and tried using the steps above, as they are the canonical Python way of creating virtual environments. However, we realize working that way might be tricky for Anaconda users since Anaconda usually changes the configurations of your machine. If you are having too many problems getting started, then feel free to use the "conda way" of handling environments.  I.e.: create a virtual environment with `conda create --name foundations`.
3. Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. 
  > **Note for Anaconda users**: Same as above, if you are having too many problems getting started, then feel free to activate the environment with `conda activate foundations` instead.
4. Install its dependencies on editable mode with `pip install -e .[dev]`. Install its dependencies on editable mode with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
