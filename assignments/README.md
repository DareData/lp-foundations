# Foundations Learning Path Assignments

## Introduction

This assignment uses life expectancy in Europe grouped by Country (or other, like group of countries), Age, Sex, and Time. But the data format makes it hard to use. The task consists into cleaning the data and applying the concepts you've learned in the previous modules.

## Installing

2. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`. If you are using conda, you can create a virtual environment with `conda create --name foundations`.
3. Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. 
  > **Note for Anaconda users**: Same as above, if you are having too many problems getting started, then feel free to activate the environment with `conda activate foundations` instead.
4. Install its dependencies on editable mode with `pip install -e .[dev]`. Install its dependencies on editable mode with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
